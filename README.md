# TerminalArt

A small Rust project I built for fun that generates Ascii art based on the given input text

## About
There’s no big goal behind it — I mainly wanted to:
- experiment with terminal rendering
- write some Rust just for enjoyment
- build something small and complete

## Features
- Prints ASCII/Unicode art in the terminal
- Simple and fast
- Cross-platform
- Pure Rust, no heavy dependencies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (stable)
- Cargo

### Run
```bash
cargo run
